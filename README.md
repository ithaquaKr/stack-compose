# The Application stack in docker-compose Library

Popular application, containerized in docker-compose and ready to launch.

## Philosophy

This project strives to be the most accessible entry point for those wanting to experiment with building application stacks using Docker Compose.
It prioritizes a minimalist and unopinionated approach. There's a focus on minimal external dependencies and custom automation, ensuring a quick and easy setup.

Instead, i believe in good docs so that you can use this repository as a template, tweak it, and make it **your own**.
